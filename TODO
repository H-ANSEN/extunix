* describe configure step
* write guidelines (and follow them)
* build system is too complex, use simple Makefile?

[SLG]
* write some guideline about what can enter extunix and what not:
  - POSIX only funcall?
  - POSIX + Linux/BSD with reasonnable behavior if they are missing?
  - POSIX + Win32 (unlikely)?
  - Should not add extra dependencies on external library?
  - Can add extra deps if reasonnable (libacl, libattr) wrt to POSIX?

* avoid using pa_def: the signature of extunix depends on what is available ->
  the signature is almost never the same from one computer to another.

  Better have exception or have_eventfd: unit -> bool. This way the changing
  part are the C library and we avoid signature change of extunix.ml
